# Claude Code Rules for this project

## Language
- Always respond in Japanese (日本語で応答してください)
- Use Japanese for all explanations, comments, and documentation
- Keep technical terms in English when appropriate (e.g., API, WebSocket, React)

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code formatting conventions
- Write clear, concise comments in Japanese

## Project Context
- This is a multi-agent development system
- Backend: Node.js with Hono framework
- Frontend: React with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- Communication: WebSocket for real-time updates

## Important Notes
- Always maintain Japanese language in responses, even in compact mode
- Prioritize code quality and maintainability
- Follow the specifications in specification.md

## Git Operations
- NEVER execute `git commit` directly without explicit user confirmation
- When asked to commit changes:
  1. Show the commit message you plan to use
  2. Ask: "このコミットメッセージで実行してよろしいですか？ (y/N)"
  3. Only proceed if user explicitly responds with "y", "yes", "はい", or "実行"
- This rule applies even if the user says "commit" - always confirm first
- Commands in `.claude/settings.local.json` "ask" list require explicit confirmation
